I am a Master's student at the [University of Eberswalde](https://www.hnee.de), Germany. Thoroughout my years of study, I gained experience in both academic and professional experience in the GIS and RS real applications. I have experience working on different RS-related topics and projects. And I am hard-working with both analytical and problem-solving skills. What can I do? All environmental and urban-related analysis and features' computations, density assumptions, urban mapping, landslides, LUCC. Pre-plan/urban calculations, infrastructures, ground truth, earth features, parameterization, 3D simulations and enivornmental modelling.
My resumee and More information about my research and career can be found on my [personal website](https://ham811.github.io/).
